# SimpleLazyConsolChat

Use consol to use chat, there is no any serious logic inside, just simple chat, as my multithreading training.

You can use telnet to communicate with server

Steps to run application:
1) Run Server(ChatServer.class)
2) Use your consol or smth else to connect server(if you use telnet your command will look like:
                                                          telnet 127.0.0.1 8080)
3) Enjoy your texting with your "clones")

Eddition, use two or more consols to chat with each other.
